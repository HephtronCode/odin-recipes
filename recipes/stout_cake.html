    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This moist chocolate stout cake with chocolate caramel frosting gains intensity and flavor from stout beer. It pairs beautifully with the rich, luscious chocolate-caramel frosting. Give yourself plenty of time to make this cake—it requires several hours of cooling time.</p>

        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bring stout and butter to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add cocoa powder and whisk until mixture is smooth. Cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat eggs and sour cream in another large bowl until smooth. Add stout mixture to egg mixture and beat just to combine. Add flour mixture and beat briefly on slow speed. Using a rubber spatula, fold batter until completely combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer cake to rack; cool completely in the pan, then turn cake out onto rack for frosting.</li>
        <li>Place chocolate chips in a medium bowl. Bring cream and corn syrup to a simmer in a small saucepan; pour over chocolate chips. Let sit for 2 minutes; whisk until smooth. Let frosting sit at room temperature until slightly thickened, about 1 hour. Pour over cake; let stand until frosting is set, about 4 hours.</li>
    </ol>
